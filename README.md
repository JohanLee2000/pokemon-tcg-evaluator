## Pokemon TCG Evaluator
This app allows users to search for Pokemon Cards which they wish to buy or evaluate for pricing using tcgplayer or card market. Users will be able to look up information on the card which is derived from the Pokemon TCG Developer API and make a reasonable judgment. It will also feature a collections page where users can store their favorite Pokemon cards and create their own decks.

This project is currently in progress. It is being developed in React Native, Expo, and TypeScript.
Any contributions or collaboration is welcome. Message johanlee2000@gmail.com for details.
